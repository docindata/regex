        "\n",
        "The following document is my personal notes while learning Regex, it's by no means a comprehensive guide.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 What is Regex?\n",
        "\n",
        "Regex is a great tool available in similar syntax in quite a few programming languages, it can be used on string to find patterns of text, numeber and other characters. Strings may be found, removed, manipulated, extracted etc\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 How to start Regex in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "First of all, load the library __re__\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import re\n",
        "```\n",
        "Then use some of its functions on a pre-defined string. \n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 The Most Important Functions in the re module\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `re.findall` is the most basic, it runs through all the provided string and looks for the pattern in all of it. Not always optimal if the string is very long and we're looking for one match only.\n",
        "2. `re.match` looks for only one match only in the beginning of the string. Stops after finding one match.\n",
        "3. `re.search` looks for only one match whereever in the string. Stops after finding one match.\n",
        "4. `re.finditer` finds one match then stops, until it is iterated on again. The iteration can be conditional, as stop after 4 finding for example.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `re.group` is used to access sub-groups within the found pattern. We'll go into groups further on.\n",
        "2. `re.sub` finds and substitutes the found pattern.\n",
        "3. `re.split` splits the string at the place of a specific pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.4 The Regex Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "First of all, Regex has to be written in __raw__ string format.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "r\"regex_body\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "and not as a normal string\n",
        "```python\n",
        "\"regex_body\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "becuase inverted slash `\\` is used alot in regex and non-raw strings are programmed to interact with `\\` in a way that will alter the pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second of all, to leverage the full power of regex, __metacharacters__ are used to look for patterns, see below\n",
        "```python\n",
        "r\"\\w+\\s\\d+\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "which will look for a word made of one or more characters, followed by a singel space and one or more digits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a table on some metacharacter's character classes which are used to find any character or characters of ceratin type.  \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "| Character class | Use |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
